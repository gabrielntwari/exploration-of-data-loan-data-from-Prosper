##  exploration-of-dataloandatafrom-Prosper

### Introduction
This project aims to reveal any insights gleaned from my data exploration. 
The goal is to use exploratory and explanatory data analysis approaches to analyze the Prosper Loans dataset and identify actionable insights.

### Dataset

The dataset is from Prosper Marketplace Inc. a company that provides loans to a borrowers. It contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.Based on the mentioned variables a loan can be granted or not.

### Summary of Findings
The dataset have been cleaned and the columns containing 75% of Null values in their contained have been removed and the data without prosper score thave been removed.

Individual variables have been analysed using diferent data visualizations such as pie chart,histograms and bar graphs.From Analyis, it is found that employed individulas of 50,000-74,999 dollars are likely to apply for loans more than others.Professionals,Executives,Computer Programmers,Teachers,Analysts ,Administrative Assistants are top borrowers in Prosper Marketplace Inc.
For Bivariate analysis, in 2011 and 2012 was the years where rates was very high compared to other years.The highest rating of AA received lowest APR (5.6%), whereas the lowerest rating received the highest APR (22.2%).The people with higher rating tend to be more reliable and therefore given lower BorrowerAPR.
In multivariate exploration, it's observed that within each income range group, the rate increases as the term increases, but for the same term, people with houses(house owners) are able to be granted a lower interest rate.A lthough ProsperScore has a negative correlation with rates, whether the borrowers are homeowners still proves to decide whether they can get a lower interest rate, i.e., a homeowner who has the same score as a non-homeowner can enjoy lower rates. Also, interest rates decrease as income ranges increase, despite different LoanStatus
